# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- `deny.toml` with an explicit license allow-list (MIT, Apache-2.0, ISC,
  Unicode-DFS-2016, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause) and `cargo-deny` integrated
  into the CI `audit` job.
- Doc comment on `spawn_pipeline_with_config` in `stages.rs` (was absent,
  leaving a public API surface without documentation).
- `# Errors` section added to `metrics::init_metrics` doc comment.
- CI: `cargo deny check` step added to the `audit` job alongside the existing
  `rustsec/audit-check` action.

### Fixed

- Misplaced doc lines in `stages.rs`: the two doc sentences that belonged to
  `validated_channel_size` (a private helper) were incorrectly appended to the
  preceding public function's `# Panics` block. Both items are now correctly
  attributed.

### Changed

- Version bumped from `0.1.0` to `1.0.0` -- the public API is stable.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `cargo doc --no-deps -D warnings` step added to CI to prevent documentation regressions.
- Module-level doc comment for `enhanced` with feature-table overview of all six sub-modules.
- `gather()` function in `metrics` now has a proper `///` doc comment (was accidentally merged with an adjacent comment).
- CI: added `--no-default-features` build and test steps to catch compilation breakage when all optional features are disabled.
- CI: `cargo doc` step now uses `--all-features` so feature-gated public API is always verified.
- CI: fixed bench step to reference the correct bench target name (`pipeline` not `bench_pipeline`).
- Tests: `tier_integration_tests.rs` — independent integration tests for each of the four self-improvement tiers (self-tune, self-modify, intelligence, evolution), each gated by the corresponding feature flag.
- Tests: four additional distributed tests covering quorum loss, partial quorum loss, leader election initial state, and leader step-down error handling.
- Docstrings: `SessionId::new`, `SessionId::as_str` now have `///` doc comments.
- Docstrings: `PromptRequest` fields `session`, `input`, and `meta` now have `///` field doc comments.
- Docstrings: `PipelineStage` variants and `as_str` method now have `///` doc comments.

### Fixed

- Misplaced doc comment in `metrics.rs`: the doc block that was intended for `gather()` was positioned above `record_inference_cost()`. Both functions now have their correct, isolated doc comments.
- `src/bin/self_improve.rs`: replaced `.expect("LoopConfig is valid")` with a graceful error handler that logs via `tracing::error!` and exits with code 1.
- `src/main.rs`: replaced `.expect("output_rx must be present")` with an explicit match that logs via `tracing::error!` and exits with code 1 instead of panicking.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-01

### Added

- Five-stage async pipeline: RAG, Assemble, Inference, Post-process, Stream.
- Bounded `tokio::sync::mpsc` channels with configurable capacity and graceful load-shedding via `send_with_shed`.
- `DeadLetterQueue` ring-buffer for inspecting and replaying shed requests.
- `ModelWorker` trait with five production implementations: `EchoWorker`, `OpenAiWorker`, `AnthropicWorker`, `LlamaCppWorker`, `VllmWorker`.
- `LoadBalancedWorker` for round-robin distribution across multiple backends.
- `CircuitBreaker` (open/half-open/closed) with configurable failure threshold, timeout, and success-rate probe.
- `Deduplicator` — collapses identical in-flight prompts into a single inference call; unblocks all waiters on completion.
- `RetryPolicy` with exponential back-off, jitter, and per-attempt timeout.
- `CacheLayer` — in-process LRU cache with TTL for inference results.
- `RateLimiter` — token-bucket rate limiter configurable via `RateLimitConfig`.
- `PriorityQueue` with four-level priority scheduling.
- `ModelRouter` — complexity-scored routing between local llama.cpp and cloud APIs; adaptive threshold tuning.
- `PipelineConfig` — declarative TOML configuration with `deny_unknown_fields`, hot-reload support, and optional JSON Schema export.
- Prometheus metrics: 18 counters, histograms, and gauges covering every pipeline stage and resilience primitive.
- OpenTelemetry tracing integration with OTLP/Jaeger export and graceful fallback when no collector is present.
- `init_tracing()` with `RUST_LOG_FORMAT=json` support for structured log aggregation pipelines.
- `SessionId` with FNV-1a based `shard_session` for stable session affinity across process restarts.
- `PromptRequest::with_deadline` for per-request time-to-live enforcement.
- `PipelineStage` enum with `Display` for consistent metric/log labelling.
- Coordination module: TOML-driven agent fleet management with atomic filesystem-lock task claiming.
- `AgentSpawner`, `TaskQueue`, and `AgentMonitor` for zero-panic agent lifecycle management.
- Self-tuning stack (`self-tune` feature): PID controllers, telemetry bus, anomaly detection (Z-score + CUSUM), snapshot store.
- Self-modify stack (`self-modify` feature): task generation, validation gate (cargo test + clippy), agent memory.
- Intelligence layer (`intelligence` feature): `LearnedRouter` (epsilon-greedy bandit), `Autoscaler`, `FeedbackCollector`, `QualityEstimator`, `PromptOptimizer`, `SemanticDedup`.
- Evolution module (`evolution` feature): A/B experiments, snapshot rollback, transfer learning.
- Distributed mode (`distributed` feature): NATS pub/sub, Redis-based cross-node dedup, leader election with TTL renewal.
- TUI terminal dashboard (`tui` feature) built with ratatui: live stage latency, circuit-breaker status, dedup savings, sparklines.
- Web API (`web-api` feature): REST, WebSocket, and SSE streaming endpoints via axum.
- Metrics HTTP server (`metrics-server` feature): Prometheus scrape endpoint.
- MCP server (`mcp` feature): `infer`, `pipeline_status`, `batch_infer`, and `configure_pipeline` tools callable from Claude Desktop and Claude Code.
- CI: build, clippy `-D warnings`, rustfmt check, tests (default + all-features), MSRV 1.85, publish dry-run, benchmark regression check, `cargo audit` security scan.
- Clippy lints `unwrap_used` and `expect_used` set to `deny` in `Cargo.toml`.
- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` enforced across all production code paths.
