[build]
# Isolate build artifacts for this workspace.
# Each parallel agent session should set CARGO_TARGET_DIR in the environment
# to a unique path (e.g., target/agent-<uuid>) to avoid LNK1104 file lock
# contention on Windows. This fallback keeps Claude Code sessions off the
# default `target/` directory used by editors (e.g., rust-analyzer / VS Code).
#
# Agents: export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/agent-$(date +%s%N) before cargo commands.
# If you hit LNK1104 or file lock errors: wait 30 seconds, then retry once.
# Do NOT spawn parallel build attempts to resolve lock errors.
